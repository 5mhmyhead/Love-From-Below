## A little 2D Game made in Java to learn more about the Swing functionality and game development in general.
This project was built along with multiple YouTube tutorials that involves using built in Java functionality and without the need for external libraries. 

I send my huge thanks to **RyiSnow** and **M3832** for giving me such detailed tutorials on Java game development and I would have never started this project without their guidance. Special thanks to **rcya1 (Ryan Chang)** for their NES Legend of Zelda project made with Java. I took much inspiration from how they structured their code and taking important concepts of managing data between classes.
